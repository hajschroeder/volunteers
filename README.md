## Description

This is an independant project for the coding school Epicodus. It is a application that uses Ruby and Sinatra that allows an employee of a non-profit to track which projects have a one-to-many association with volunteers. Both "projects" and "volunteers" have full CRUD functionality. 

## Setup/Installation
_Note, this will require your local device to have Ruby installed_
* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Open the folder saved to your desktop with VSCode (or any other IDE capable of running Ruby scripts)
* Bundle the gems by typing 'gem bundle install'. This will also install Sinatra to the project
* Open a new terminal and from the root directory of the project type 'ruby app.rb'
* In the browser navigate to 'localhost:4567' 
* From there you may access the application and start adding, deleting, and editing projects and their volunteers.
